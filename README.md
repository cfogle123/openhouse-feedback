# Open House Feedback — The List Realty

A simple internal site for agents to log open house visitors and feedback, replacing the shared spreadsheet. Each agent gets their own page (no login needed — just pick your name); there's also an "All Entries" admin view with CSV export, a house address list, and a "Browse by house" view with bulk delete.

## Tech stack
